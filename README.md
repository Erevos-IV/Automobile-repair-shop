Case:
When a customer brings in a vehicle, a service advisor will write up a repair order. This order will identify the customer and the vehicle, along with the date of service and the name of the advisor.
A vehicle might need several different types of service in a single visit. These could include oil change, lubrication, rotate tires, and so on. Each type of service also has a flat book rate that is charged.
